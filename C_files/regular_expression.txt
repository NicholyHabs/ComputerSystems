Basic Regular Expression Syntax
===============================

The regex is typically enclosed in quotes to mark it as a single string

Individual characters are matched exactly

    'cat' matches all instances of the consecutive letters cat
    
Character sets are enclosed in square brackets

    '[aeiou]' matches any vowel
    any instance of any vowel in any word 
Multiple things may be concatenated

    'x[aeiou]' matches x followed by any vowel
   x followed by any instance of any vowel in any word 

A dash may indicate sequential groupings

    '[a-z]' indicates all letters lowercase a through z
    '[0-9]' indicates all digits

^ matches the beginning of a line

    '^[aeiou]' matches a line that starts with any vowel
    
$ matches the end of a line

    '[aeiou]$' matches a line that ends with any vowel

[^ ] matches anything *not* in the brackets

    'q[^u]' matches anything that starts with q- but not qu-
    
\| may be used to indicate a choice of two expressions

    '^x\|x$' matches lines starting or ending with x
    
* is the Kleene closure: matches 0 or more instances

    '^he[a-z]*he$' matches all lines starting and ending with he
    '^[^aeiou]*$ matches all lines with no vowels
    
+ matches at least one instance

? matches 0 or 1 instances but no more

\{n\} matches exactly n instances

    '[aeiou]\{5\}' finds all strings of five vowels
    
\{n,k\} matches at least n but not more than k instances

\{n,\} matches n or more instances

. matches any character

    '^..$' matches all two character lines
    
    
Practice
========

Find all words containing zz

Find all words containing q followed by a consonant

Find all words that start with x followed by a consonant

Find all words that start with 3 vowels

Find all words that start with five or more consonants

Find all words ending in -orilla

Find all words that start and end with a and contain an x

Write a regular expression for phone numbers of the form
   xxx-xxx-xxxx

What if we want the - to be optional?

What if we want the first three digits to be enclosed in ( )?
